    Displays the user guide for understanding cost analyses on the platform.

    This guide explains in simple, business-oriented terms:
    - Total, average, and trending costs.
    - Color-coded alerts for budget monitoring.
    - Forecasts and confidence intervals.
    - Monte Carlo simulations for anticipating budget overruns.
    - Risk indicators (Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall).
    - Individual model predictions and resource usage.
    - Token input/output distribution explained in simple terms.
    - Practical tips to optimize model usage and control costs.

    This function takes no parameters and returns nothing. It is designed to be
    called from the main Streamlit app to display the guide.
